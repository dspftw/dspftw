We started by thinking of a signal as a list of (complex) numbers where each value represents the energy of the signal at a particular time. That is, we think of energy for a each moment in time. Now we think of energy for each frequency. We compute the energy for a given frequency by correlating a sinusoid at that with our signal.\n",
